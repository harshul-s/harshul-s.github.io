### Hi there 👋 I'm Harshul Singh. An incoming New Grad SWE @[Meta](https://www.meta.com/) and a CMU alum.

Through my time at CMU I've cultivated an interest in software that spans the stack from working on bare metal with an embedded RTOS to network programming and scalable web applications. I've also worked at the intersection of software and hardware through my interest in Robotics.

I'm passionate about creating and working engineering solutions that effect meaningful change for communities and our collective future.
