We wï»¿orked to Implement Conflict Based Search to compare and contrast it's performance and completeness in a simulation with multiple agents representing autonomous vehicles being controlled as part of some centralized fleet. 

We found that the structure of searching a conflict tree led to exponential time complexity impacting the performance of the planner significantly. However, we were able to structure scenarios and orderings of agents such that a prioritized planner would fail to find a path and CBS  would be capable of finding a solution.
