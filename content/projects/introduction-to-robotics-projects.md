W﻿orked with Lego hardware and RasPi/Python Based software to solve a series of labs.

N﻿otable Labs:

*  ﻿USAR  Final Project (Unmanned Search And Rescue): Given the task ahead of time with unknown terrain we designed an unmanned tele-operated robot with active illumination, a webcam to recognize and decode fiducials, and a hook based platform to 'rescue' a lego minifigure.
* A﻿* Path Planning: Given a map configuration design a planner to generate a trajectory that the robot is able to follow and track in the real world using odometry with low latency and varying map resolution.
* I﻿nverted Pendulum: Bridging the gap in simulated PID control vs PID control on real motors to stabilise an inverted pendulum
* D﻿riveTrain RR arm: Performed inverse kinematics with an RR arm using only one motor
