#### O﻿verview:

F﻿ollowed the end to end design process utilizing systems engineering practices and project management strategies as a team of 3 to build the end product over 12 weeks. We created an AR App that tracks vacuum coverage over a room along with integrating with a separate compute module on an NVIDIA Jetson running computer vision to provide feedback to the user on the actual cleanliness of the area just traversed.
